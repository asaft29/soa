# ROA

A REST API built using the **ROA (Rust Oriented Architecture)** approach—a (joking) term for a microservice-based architecture.

***Disclaimer:*** *"Rust Oriented Architecture" (ROA) is a term I completely made up for fun. Please don't get mad or angry about it!

> [!WARNING]
> I will be forced to sue anyone who uses this groundbreaking term without giving me proper credit. This is, of course, also a joke... unless?

## Design

The REST API design adheres to **HATEOAS** (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) constraints to promote discoverability and a decoupled architecture.
